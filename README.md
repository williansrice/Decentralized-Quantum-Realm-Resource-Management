## Usage

### Allocating Quantum Particles

```javascript
// Initialize the system
const dqrrm = require('quantum-realm-system');
const system = new dqrrm.System(config);

// Request quantum particle allocation
const allocationRequest = await system.allocateQuantumParticles({
  particleTypes: {
    qubits: 50,
    qudits: 10,
    photonPairs: 15
  },
  particleProperties: {
    minCoherenceTime: "500Î¼s",
    minFidelity: 0.995,
    entanglementReady: true
  },
  computationalPurpose: "QUANTUM_MACHINE_LEARNING",
  priority: "high",
  duration: "4h",
  reservationTime: "2023-08-15T14:30:00Z"
});

// Confirm allocation
const allocation = await allocationRequest.confirm();
console.log(`Allocation confirmed. Resource ID: ${allocation.resourceId}`);
console.log(`Allocated nodes: ${allocation.nodeIdentifiers.join(', ')}`);
```

### Tracking Superposition States

```javascript
// Get a quantum resource group
const resourceGroup = await system.getQuantumResource("resource-id-573921");

// Set up state tracking
const stateTracking = await resourceGroup.trackSuperpositionStates({
  monitoringResolution: "high",
  updateFrequency: "100ms",
  nonDestructiveMode: true,
  probabilityThreshold: 0.01,
  trackingMetrics: ["amplitudes", "phases", "entanglement-correlations"],
  alertConditions: {
    coherenceBelowThreshold: 0.9,
    unexpectedStateTransitions: true,

// Get current state snapshot
const stateSnapshot = await stateTracking.getCurrentState();
console.log(`Current superposition complexity: ${stateSnapshot.complexityIndex}`);
console.log(`Dominant basis state: |${stateSnapshot.dominantState}> (${stateSnapshot.dominantProbability * 100}%)`);
```

### Optimizing Entanglement Networks

```javascript
// Get the entanglement network
const entanglementNetwork = await system.getEntanglementNetwork("network-id-294782");
